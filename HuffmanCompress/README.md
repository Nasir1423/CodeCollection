# Description
This folder serves as a repository for storing **Huffman compression** code. The code implements file compression using Huffman coding but does not include decompression. The repository includes two sample text files for testing and two Python script named `HuffmanCoding.py`, `MinHeap.py`
Certainly! Here's the updated set of instructions in English:

# Usage Instructions:
1. First, download all the code files from the repository. Ensure that you have obtained the `HuffmanCoding.py` file and any other potential dependency files.
2. Open your Python development environment or terminal.
3. Use your Python environment or terminal to navigate to the directory containing the downloaded files.
4. Run the `HuffmanCoding.py` file. You can use the following command (assuming you have Python installed): `python HuffmanCoding.py`
5. The compression program will compress the default text file (usually `sample_text.txt`) and generate a compressed binary file (`sample_text_encoded.bin`).
6. You can observe the code's execution and check the size of the compressed file to assess the effectiveness of Huffman coding compression.
